# ML4VA-Project: Restaurant Recommender
This is a ML projet constructed by Andrew Lin, Ali Ibrahim, and Kaleb Getachew. (Fall 2020)

## Abstract
In order to alleviate some of the financial hardships felt by local restaurants, 
we will build a local restaurant recommender system that will be deployed to a website 
for people to use. Users will go on the website and enter some details about themselves 
and then predictions will be made on cuisine preferences. The website will then recommend 
three random restaurants, previously hand-picked, for each of the predicted cuisines. 
The locality of the restaurants will depend on what county the user selects.
